A basic script to convert a song in 4/4 to 3/4. This script is useful for people who like to waltz.

This is an extremely simple script that stretches the 1st and 4th beat and makes the 2nd and 3rd beat twice as fast as the 1st and 4th beat. There are probably other ways to convert a song to 3/4 such as cutting out out the 2nd beat entirely. I welcome any feedback.  

Large parts of this script are based on Tristan's swinger.py. My original intention for this script was to play around with the Echo Nest API, exercise my pythan script, and create a simple way to convert a song to 3/4. A lot of room for this project to grow.
